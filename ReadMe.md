# Data Science Functions
This is Samuel P. Folledo's Data Science functions like __mean, median, mode, percentile, covariance, probability__ programmed in Python, __without using numpy__ as a homework assigned in my Data Science 1.0 course in Make School

## Covariance 
This method takes in a 2-dimensional array of any size in x or y and returns the covariance of a dataset in a form of a matrix, a.k.a. a 2D array

### What Is Covariance?
__Covariance__ In probability theory and statistics, covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. Covariance measures the directional relationship between the returns on two assets. A positive covariance means that asset returns move together while a negative covariance means they move inversely. Covariance is calculated by analyzing at-return surprises (standard deviations from the expected return) or by multiplying the correlation between the two variables by the standard deviation of each variable.

### [What is Probability?](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/QL-1.1/blob/master/Notebooks/Probability.ipynb)
Probability is all about the __chances of an event occurring__ or how likely an event is to occur, in a set of events.
