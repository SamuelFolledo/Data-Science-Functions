# Math Functions
This is my Math functions like __mean, median, mode, covariance, percentile__ coded in Python, __without using numpy__ for my Data Science 1.0 course in Make School

# Covariance 
This method takes in a 2-dimensional array of any size in x or y and returns the covariance of a dataset in a form of a matrix, a.k.a. a 2D array

## What Is Covariance?
__Covariance__ In probability theory and statistics, covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. Covariance measures the directional relationship between the returns on two assets. A positive covariance means that asset returns move together while a negative covariance means they move inversely. Covariance is calculated by analyzing at-return surprises (standard deviations from the expected return) or by multiplying the correlation between the two variables by the standard deviation of each variable.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Covariance is a statistical tool that is used to determine the relationship between the movement of two asset prices.
- When two stocks tend to move together, they are seen as having a positive covariance; when they move inversely, the covariance is negative.
- Covariance is a significant tool in modern portfolio theory used to ascertain what securities to put in a portfolio.
- Risk and volatility can be reduced in a portfolio by pairing assets that have a negative covariance.
