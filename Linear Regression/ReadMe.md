# R-Squared for Linear Regression
HW3 - R-Squared for Linear Regression for my Data Science 1.0 course in Make School

https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/QL-1.1/blob/master/Assignments/HW3.ipynb

## Part 1
- Read [this wiki page about R-squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination#Definitions)

## Part 2
- Write a Python function that computes R-squared for our distance and drinking water datasets (shown at the top of this page) when w_1 = 0.25163494 and w_0 = 0.79880123
